                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a rising senior at UMass Lowell. I am currently studying
                    computer science and am primarily interested in software
                    engineering. I love everything tech, finance, and soccer!
                    I am originally from Danvers, Massachusetts where I grew up
                    most of my life. From a young age, I always gravitated toward
                    electronics. As I grew older, my father gave me a computer and
                    the rest was history. I attended coding classes at my library and took
                    a strong interest in software development. Coupled with my obsession with
                    video games, I started to dabble in game development. Nearing the end of my
                    high school years, I decided to attend UMass Lowell as a computer science
                    student with the main goal of building the foundational knowledge required
                    so that I could become competent in the software engineering industry.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="interests"> <!-- Interest Heading and Section -->
                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p> My primary interests include outdoor sporting activities, video games,
                    coding (and tech-related projects), and finance (investing). Of the many
                    outdoor activities that I play, I have always prioritized soccer. I started
                    playing when I was around six years old and played competitively throughout 
                    high school. I decided to stop formally playing after high school to prioritize
                    my career, however, I am always playing on different clubs and teams throughout
                    Massachusetts. I have also taken a recent interest in tennis, however, I am not
                    the best at playing. When I am with a large group of friends I also like to play
                    basketball. In regard to my interest in tech, I am currently working on some side
                    projects and learning new technologies related to full-stack development as I have
                    a particular interest in the sub-field. I also like to keep up to date on investing-related 
                    news and actively try to save and invest in companies that I believe in the
                    long-term (mainly in the chip and tech industry).

                <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
                <p> Over the course of the last few years, I was able to achieve a lot of amazing things pertaining to some of the goals
                    that I had regarding software engineering. Upon entering UMass Lowell, I was able to be awarded some amazing scholarships
                    and awards. I was also able to create some nice projects (some of which I did in school). Most notably, I recently finished
                    a co-op at Abiomed, where I worked as a software engineer (algorithms). I worked on a very interesting applied research project
                    with the goal of determining project feasibility.
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Upon entering UMass Lowell I was awarded the John and Abigail Adams Scholarship. I also
                            received Dean's Scholarship. Since I was in the top 10 percentile of my high school class,
                            I was awarded the North Shore Chambers of Commerce Honors Scholars Recognition. I have also
                            been on the Dean's list for all of my years at UMass Lowell.
                        </li>
                        <li>One of the projects that I worked on was in one of my computing classes. It is called the "N-Body Simulation"
                            and the primary goal of this project was to develop a command-line application in C++ that simulated the
                            motion of N particles in a plane all while considering gravitational forces and numeric properties for each particle.
                        </li>
                        <li>My software engineering co-op at Abiomed was a valuable experience. I worked on an advanced development project which worked
                            with the companies flagship minimally invasive heart pump and AIC (Automated Impella Controller) to create a new mode on the
                            controller which would enable net zero flow across the pump while the pump was inserted in the patient.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
